# LPC2148_TempSensor_Project
---

## ▶️ Getting Started

1. Flash the code onto the LPC2148 board using Keil µVision + Flash Magic.
2. Connect the sensor output to the ADC pin (e.g., P0.28).
3. Connect the LCD to correct data and control pins as defined in `Lcd_4bit.h`.
4. Power on the system and observe temperature reading on the LCD.

## 📚 Dependencies

- Keil µVision
- Flash Magic for flashing code
- Custom header files: `PLL.h`, `Lcd_4bit.h`, `ADC.h`

## ✅ To-Do / Future Improvements

- Add UART support for serial display
- Log data to SD card or EEPROM
- Add buzzer alert for high temperature
- Use RTOS for task management (optional)
